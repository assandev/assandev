### Hi there! <img src="aang.gif" width="50" style="border-radius: 50%; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: -4px;" />

I'm [Andres](https://assandev.vercel.app/), AI Engineer & Product Thinker.

I like building AI-driven systems end-to-end, from understanding the problem and the people behind it, to designing system architectures and delivering production-ready solutions.

- Agentic Orchestration
- RAG Architecture
- GenAI
- LLM API Integration
- Prompt Engineering
- AI Evaluation Frameworks
